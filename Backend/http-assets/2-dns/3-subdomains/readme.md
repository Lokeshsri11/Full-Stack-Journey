# Subdomains

We learned about how a domain name resolves to an IP address, which is just a computer on a network - often the internet.

A *subdomain* prefixes a domain name, allowing a domain to route network traffic to many different servers and resources. 

For example, the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) website that you're on right now is hosted on a different computer than our blog. Our blog, found at [blog.boot.dev](blog.boot.dev) is hosted on our "blog" subdomain.
