#HTTP Requests and Responses
At the heart of HTTP is a simple request-response system. The "requesting" computer, also known as the "client", asks another computer for some information. That computer, "the server" sends back a response with the information that was requested.

We'll talk about the specifics of how the "requests" and "responses" are formatted later. For now, just think of it as a simple question-and-answer system.

Request: "What are the items in the Loki game?"
Response: A list of the items in the Loki game.
